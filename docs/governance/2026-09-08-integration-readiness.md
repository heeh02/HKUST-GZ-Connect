# Integration and transfer readiness snapshot

- Status: Readback and proposed sequencing; no merge, release or transfer authorization
- Owner: project maintainers, Architecture and Release
- Verified: 2026-09-08
- Scope: repository ID `1279507615`, destination `HKUSTGZ-OpenSource`
- Public main: `9e1135c05dc21998c66627e25477d4bd799cd5d7`

## What is authoritative now

The repository remains `heeh02/HKUST-GZ-Connect`. Stable `v2.0.1` is published (Release
`383930896`), and its annotated tag resolves to the main commit above. The asset inventory has four
installers and three source/build/checksum receipts. Those historical digests were not redownloaded
or revalidated in this documentation audit.

The installed Mac app reports **2.0.2**, not 2.0.0 or published 2.0.1. Its ASAR SHA-256 is
`3c58f7c431a19af3b6d746c22150d79e46b23092fa91c54aad393737a4c2d1bd`.
Its Card Board controller is byte-identical to the original `b3cdc0a` build, not the later PR #106
repairs. A version label does not prove that the latest source is installed. No app was launched,
downgraded or replaced during this readback; no settings, accounts or browser profiles were read.

Main still contains stale 2.0.0/status and unknown-Organization wording. PR #89 corrects that truth;
the correction is not on main until reviewed and merged. Main does contain the six scoped AGENTS,
contributor/security/conduct files, CODEOWNERS, documentation index and module inventory. No tracked
`docs/superpowers/` remains. There are still 59 root-level Desktop test files on main.

## Existing PR queue — do not flatten the dependency chain

| #88 | Real ProxyCommand pipe flushing | main | Independent review and chosen-source package validation |
| #95 | Compatible local-proxy default | main | Security/UX review; not currently shipped from main |
| #107 | Native Windows active-context fixtures | main | Test review; does not resolve all Windows-suite debt |
| #106 | 2.0.2 calendar/category behavior | main | Review and new exact-source installers; old packages are stale |

Review independent main-based changes first/as available; preserve the #106 → #108 → #109 → #110
order when integrating that lane. Refresh dependent diffs and rerun affected checks after any base
change. Do not batch administrator merges or reuse a parent's receipt as proof of a new combination.
The ProxyCommand run `33957101203` is successful at the exact #88 head; job `101282297142` records
successful **Verify real Windows ProxyCommand pipes**. That is real CI evidence for #88, not an
authorization or a green result for every other PR. Native/local results elsewhere remain distinct.

## Completion audit — still open

| Goal area | Current evidence | Still missing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G0 truth | Baseline documents exist; #89 reconciles published/installed/candidate states | Correction on main and final consistent index |
| G1 contributor contracts | Scoped instructions and templates exist | Independent accountable review and effective enforcement |
| G2 ownership | Main inventory; #110 static Renderer guard; #107 fixture repairs | Integrated checks, remaining test moves, full module/public-boundary coverage |
| G3 / M1 | Two explicit feature seams plus view/CSS and static policy in #108–110 | Runtime lifecycle registry, remaining globals, locale ownership and final integration |
| G3 / M2–M4 | Substantial separate local candidates exist | Reconciled reviewed changes, target ownership metrics, exact combined regression/package proof |
| G4 | Organization/Owner and updater bridge confirmed | Permission decision, published-bridge UI acceptance, authorization, snapshots and post-transfer verification |

The local backend candidate `26f67fb3e2f295a6434254d6b31c44b457c634e9` shares the current main
base. Its source has Main 1166 lines, Campus Browser 1499 and Engine CLI 499, versus main's
1719/1854/2485. These are source-size observations, not fresh behavioral acceptance. Browser still
exceeds the 600-line owner target; Main still exceeds the final 500–700-line target.

A read-only `git merge-tree --write-tree --name-only --no-messages` simulation between that backend
candidate and the #110 head reports **23 conflicting files**. They include the session manager,
Renderer bootstrap/calendar/styles, boundary tools, renamed tests, instructions and module map.
Neither branch alone proves the combination. Integrate owned domains selectively and rerun exact
contracts; do not resolve these conflicts by wholesale choosing an older side or regenerating
exceptions. No checkout or branch was merged by this simulation.

Git metadata currently lists 69 local worktrees. This is not a deletion list: unmerged refs,
uncommitted work and necessary receipts must survive. Avoid new duplicate worktrees where an owned
clean branch suffices. Any retirement needs an exact target/owner/status inventory, not broad cleanup.

## When ownership can move

`HKUSTGZ-OpenSource` is Organization `325204819`; the authenticated maintainer has active admin/Owner
membership. No same-name destination repository was listed. The Organization is Free, has no teams,
default repository permission **write**, and does not require two-factor authentication. These are
observations, not permission to change settings or purchase a plan.

Main currently requires one approval and seven contexts: secret-scan, package-verifier, desktop,
desktop-electron, windows-private-file, engine, offline-tests. The repository has one collaborator
with admin role; admin enforcement, code-owner review and last-push approval are disabled. Active
tag Ruleset `22269087` remains present. Independent review is not manufactured by creating empty teams.

Transfer need not wait for every M1–M5 refactor, but must wait for the separately authorized transfer
preflight: agree base/team permissions, complete the published-bridge installation/UI acceptance,
capture fresh governance/release/open-work evidence, recheck name availability, and authorize the
exact existing repository transfer without renaming. A second trusted reviewer is needed for final
independent-review enforcement. Two-factor policy is a separate hardening decision, not a new
invented transfer prerequisite.

Do not downgrade the user's current 2.0.2 candidate just to tick the older bridge acceptance box.
Choose an explicitly approved isolated test account/host or installation workflow that preserves
user data. The existing package-code updater query is useful evidence but is not installed UI proof.
After transfer, verify numeric identity, redirects, roles, rules, releases/assets and updater behavior
using the existing playbook. Until then, source work can continue without claiming migration complete.
