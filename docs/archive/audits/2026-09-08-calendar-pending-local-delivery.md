# Calendar pending-week local delivery

The user reproduced a large loading-state replacement while selecting an uncached week.
The installed 2.0.2 candidate did contain a week cache; a never-read week nevertheless took the
legacy state-only rendering path. Earlier download/MFA changes did not address this UI defect.

Loading now retains the selected week's seven-day grid with a small bilingual sync status.
Only geometry can be reused from the prior week: no previous-week events or false empty result
are shown. Pending grid height is bounded to 140px miniature / 180px full. Cached refresh still
retains the existing DOM; errors retain last-good data and explicit authentication revocation
still removes personal cache data. No backend/API, credential or data-schema change is included.

Evidence:

- RED: uncached-week unit regression had no grid; fixed regression passes.
- 13 calendar/cache Node tests passed on Mac.
- Native Electron schedule navigation passed 360/440/960/1440 widths and 150% zoom, seven-day fit,
  zero horizontal overflow, cached-week navigation, retained refresh DOM, details and pending state.
- Linux 5070 full Desktop suite: 1,270 passed / 6 platform skips.
- Architecture, exact index secret and syntax gates passed; syntax tree
  `a5ea5a5c12c1102410ef17aa815d68c2c44e0e9b` covered 469 files.
- Mac arm64 package verifier and deep/strict signature verification passed. Packaged calendar JS,
  CSS and i18n bytes were compared against the checkout.

Local delivery:

- Replaced and relaunched `/Applications/hkustgzconnect.app`; version remains local-test 2.0.2.
- Prior ASAR: `3c58f7c431a19af3b6d746c22150d79e46b23092fa91c54aad393737a4c2d1bd`.
- Installed ASAR: `705d83f90356cf3b1973d723f4d785765cba4adbba53843394d32c5a013baf0c`.
- New process and installed archive were read back. The native workspace displayed the timetable.
- Existing arm64 Engine/helper artifacts were reused because their source was unchanged from the
  prior candidate; no Rust rebuild is claimed. The local bundle is Apple Development signed,
  not a notarized public package. Extra x64 build copies were excluded and the bundle reverified.
- User-data storage was not modified by the installer. One rollback app remains at
  `/tmp/hkustgz-calendar-app.ZyS0xW/previous-installed.app`; the duplicate generated new app was removed
  after its archive matched the installed copy. The temporary dependency symlink was removed.

No GitHub merge, release, tag or Organization transfer occurred. Windows/Linux installers were not
rebuilt. No manual school authentication, API probing or new-week live canary was performed.
The later native Renderer extraction PRs still need this behavior change carried across their
separate module boundary before integration; do not overwrite it with the older view implementation.
